- is jQuery a framework or a library? Explain the difference.
    jQuery is a library. A library is a collection of JS functions, variables, and structures that you can use in your applications. A framework (angular, react) has multiple libraries but you have to follow their way of writing code.

    you can copy library into a new JS file and link file to HTML file
    or you can directly link src to html using the link to the JS page

    The DOM stands for "Document Object Model". You can think of a node as a live object that you can access and change using JavaScript.

    - Change the footer content to "I am a semantic tag :)".
    - Select only my favorite brand of sports apparel.
    - Make the background of the content section `lightblue`.
    - Get how many items are in the "brands" list.
    - Remove all brands
    - Think of your favorite clothing brand and append it to the list. It should have both the `brand` and `favorite` classes.
